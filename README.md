## 🛠️ Roadmap: From Frontend to Full-Stack
This project is currently in its **Phase 1 (Frontend)**. I am currently learning **Backend Development** to transition this into a fully functional web application.

**Upcoming Updates:**
- 🔐 **User Authentication:** Replacing the prompt-based sign-in with a secure backend system.
- ☁️ **Cloud Database:** Moving from `localStorage` to a real-time database to allow all users to see each other's listings.
- 🚀 **Official Release:** Once the backend is integrated, CommunityNest will be deployed for real-world use in our community.
